# BattleshipGame-Ccode
A nice "BattleshipGame" project that my friend and I programmed for collage as a first year students. 

We used "Visual Studio Code" and GCC compiler.

It was a submission project so we needed to do some coding by the Instructions.

For playing the game you can compile the project by using the makefile (just write "make" at the Terminal), then you need to run the game with 3 files.

You can use this line to execute the game: .\Battleship.exe Board1.txt Board2.txt Simulation.txt 
first file for player 1 board, second file for player 2 board and third for simulation run.

you can make changes in the board files but make sure that you change it according to the guidelines so it will work (it needed to be writen same as in the files).

instruction:
you got:
* 4 ships sized 1.
* 3 ships sized 2.
* 2 ships sized 3.
* 1 ship sized 4.

*make sure that the ships does not borderring or on top of each other.

*if you hit a ship you got another turn.

*if you choose same spot that was already chosen, or an unvalid spot - you lose your turn.

Have fun and dont you forget to coment me.
