# BattleshipGame-Ccode
A nice "BattleshipGame" project that my friend and I programmed for collage as a first year students. 
We used "Visual Studio Code" and GCC compiler.
It was a submission project so we needed to do some coding by the Instructions.
for playing the game you need to run the exe with 3 files, first file for player 1 board, second for player 2 and third for simulation.
I added a simulation file and a board file that you should upload and you can make changes inside (it needed to be writen same as in the files).

instruction:
you got:
* 4 ships sized 1.
* 3 ships sized 2.
* 2 ships sized 3.
* 1 ship sized 4.
*make sure that the ships does not borderring or on top of each other.
*if you hit a ship you got another turn.
*if you choose same spot that was already chosen, or an unvalid spot - you lose your turn.

Have fun.
